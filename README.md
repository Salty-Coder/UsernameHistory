# UsernameHistory

### UsernameHistory is a BetterDiscord plugin to keep track of your friends' previous usernames.

From the moment you install and enable the plugin, the usernames of your friends will be tracked.

<b>Please note: you cannot see any usernames from before the plugin was installed!</b>

Usernames will be checked and saved every 10 hours. This means you will keep track of any username changes.   
Usernames will also be checked when adding or removing a friend.
